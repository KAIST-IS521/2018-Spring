### Philosophy

The main philosophy of this course is to "learn by doing". This course consists
of a series of activities. Students will develop a small program/prototype in
every activity, and push their results to Github.

### Syllabus

Detailed syllabus should be found [here](Syllabus.md)

### Q&A

Any questions? Create an [issue](Issues.md) in this repository. We will use
Github as a bulletin board.
